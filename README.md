# CustomView

Xcode looks for your custom templates at the location ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ . 

Open Terminal.app and create a directory for your custom templates like this:
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Custom

Each XCode file template is a separate folder with the extension .xctemplate. So named it as you prefer “CUSTOMNAME.xctemplate” and paste inside the template files.
